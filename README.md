<h1>Soy</h1>

Soy (Glycine max), also known as soybean and Chinese bean,[1] is a plant that belongs to the Fabaceae family, a family that also includes plants such as beans, lentils and peas. It is used in human food (in the form of soy oil, tofu, soy sauce, soy milk, soy protein, soy beans etc.) and animal feed (in the preparation of feed). The word "soy" comes from the Japanese shoyu.[2] The plant originates from China and Japan. It is a grain rich in protein. Among the mineral salts, the most present are: potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper and zinc. It is a source of some B vitamins, such as riboflavin and niacin, and also in vitamin C (ascorbic acid). But it is poor in vitamin A and does not contain vitamin D and B12.[3]

Besides these nutrients, soy contains the isoflavone,[4][5] also called phyto-oestrogen, which acts in the prevention of chronic-degenerative diseases such as breast cancer, uterine colon and prostate. Its chemical structure is similar to estrogen (female hormone) and, therefore, is a substance capable of alleviating the effects of menopause and premenstrual tension.[6]

The estrogen properties also help reduce another problem caused by hormonal deficiency: osteoporosis. In most soy-based foods, the content of isoflavones varies from 100 to 300 milligrams.[7] Soluble and insoluble dietary fibers present in soy contribute to the maintenance of glycemic level and to the improvement of insulin sensitivity, and because it has low glycemic index is relevant in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and obesity. The grain still has phytic acid, also called phytate.

Phytates are considered anti-nutritional factors, because they reduce the bioavailability in the body of some minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, copper and zinc, mainly. However, in the last decade, studies have shown that phytates also act as powerful antioxidant agents (preventing oxidation or aging of cells), thus fulfilling an important function in reducing the risks of several chronic and degenerative diseases, such as some types of cancer and arthritis. The phytate content in soybean varies from 1.5% of the grain composition, in beans from 2.5% and in brans such as wheat and rice from 4.5%.

However, it is neutralized by heating, both by cooking at home and through industrial processes (UHT process), resulting in adequate preparations for human consumption. Therefore, soy-based beverages do not have anti-nutritional factors and can be consumed safely.[8][9] Soybean oil is the most used by the world population in food preparation. Other soy products include soy-based beverages, oils, flour, soy sauce, soap, cosmetics, resins, paints, solvents and biodiesel.

Deforestation of the Amazon
The cultivation of soy is pointed out as one of the great causes of deforestation of the Amazon Forest. It is also related to land grabbing and violence against local communities, because of areas with cartor√°rio problems and invasions of production areas written and documented.

However, the soybean production areas are in force among those with the highest percentages of forest reserves and preservation areas according to the current forest code[10].
